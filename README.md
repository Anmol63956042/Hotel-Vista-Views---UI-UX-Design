UX Case Study: Hotel Vista Views
1. Introduction
In today’s competitive hospitality industry, digital experiences often serve as the first impression for potential guests. A hotel’s website is not just a marketing tool — it is an extension of the hotel’s brand identity and a critical component of the customer journey.
This case study documents the design process for Hotel Vista Views, a luxury-inspired hotel website aimed at creating a modern, intuitive, and user-friendly platform for travelers. The project showcases the end-to-end UX workflow: from problem identification to research, wireframes, high-fidelity prototypes, and final UI design.
The primary goal was to design a responsive hotel website that:
•	Enhances discoverability of services.
•	Simplifies the room booking journey.
•	Communicates the luxurious and trustworthy brand identity.
•	Appeals to both business travelers and leisure tourists.

2. Project Background
2.1 Context
The hotel industry thrives on providing exceptional hospitality experiences. However, the digital journey of customers is often neglected. Many hotels have outdated websites that are:
•	Visually unappealing.
•	Difficult to navigate.
•	Non-responsive on mobile devices.
•	Lacking clear call-to-actions for booking.
Hotel Vista Views is envisioned as a premium hotel brand. Its website must reflect luxury, professionalism, and ease of use.
2.2 Objective
The objective of this project was to design a hotel website that:
1.	Attracts users visually with modern aesthetics.
2.	Provides an intuitive navigation flow from discovery to booking.
3.	Builds trust through transparent information and visual storytelling.
4.	Improves conversion rates for room booking and inquiries.

3. Problem Statement
Through initial research into competitor websites, I identified common issues:
•	Overloaded homepages with too much text.
•	Poor visual hierarchy, making it difficult to find booking options.
•	Non-responsive designs on mobile/tablets.
•	Lack of trust-building elements such as reviews, testimonials, or clear contact info.
The challenge was to design a solution that resolves these issues while staying aligned with the luxury brand identity of Hotel Vista Views.

4. Research Phase
4.1 Competitor Analysis
I analyzed several luxury hotel websites (e.g., Taj Hotels, Marriott, Hyatt). Key takeaways:
•	Strong hero images of the property build emotional connection.
•	A clean navigation menu with only essential categories works best.
•	Booking CTAs must be prominent and repeated across pages.
•	Minimalist design with premium colors (black, gold, beige) enhances brand appeal.
4.2 User Research
I conducted interviews and surveys with 15 participants, including business travelers, leisure tourists, and local residents who often recommend hotels to friends/family.
Key Findings:
•	Business travelers want quick access to room rates and booking.
•	Leisure travelers value imagery, amenities, and trust factors.
•	Locals often look for banquet hall and event services.
•	All users expect a mobile-friendly experience.

5. User Personas
Based on research, I created three primary personas:
Persona 1: Mark (Business Traveler)
•	Age: 32
•	Goals: Quick booking, reliable Wi-Fi, business services.
•	Pain Points: Long booking forms, unclear pricing.
Persona 2: Sophia (Leisure Tourist)
•	Age: 27

•	Pain Points: Overloaded information, lack of trust in booking.
Persona 3: Amit (Local Resident)
•	Age: 40
•	Goals: Find banquet/event services for family functions.
•	Pain Points: Difficult navigation to services beyond rooms.

6. Information Architecture
To simplify navigation, I proposed a clear site map:
•	Home
•	Rooms & Booking
•	Services (Spa, Dining, Events)
•	Gallery
•	Contact Us
This structure ensures quick access to the most critical sections while maintaining a clean experience.
